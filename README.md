# Hack Recursive Function with Negative Input

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Hack related to handling negative inputs in recursive functions. The factorial function is implemented recursively and should return the factorial value of the input number. However, it does not gracefully handle negative inputs which leads to an infinite loop and eventually a stack overflow.

The `bug.hack` file shows the flawed implementation while `bugSolution.hack` provides a corrected version.
